                            <p>This Cancellation and Refund Policy shall apply to any cancellation of subscription of
                                Pharma24*7 ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") Products and applicable refunds. Company
                                shall not entertain any refund requests if cancellation of subscription is in violation
                                of this policy or its Terms of Service or if Company terminates the User account for
                                violation of its fair usage policy governed by its Terms of Service. This Cancellation
                                and Refund Policy is part of and incorporated within, and is to be read along with the
                                Terms of Service. The terms capitalised in this policy and not defined herein shall have
                                the meaning assigned to them in the Terms of Service. The User may view these Terms of
                                Service on any of our Company Products.</p>

                            <h2 style="font-size: 20px;" class="mt-5 fw-bold">1. Eligibility for Cancellation and Refunds</h2>
                            <p>Company permits cancellation of subscription if a User is not satisfied with the product
                                or service. Cancellation of a first-time subscription is eligible for refund only within
                                7 days from the date of purchase of subscription ("Purchase Date"). A User can only
                                avail the refund once. Renewal of subscription after the expiration of its term shall
                                not entitle a User to avail refund. The date on the invoice for subscription shall be
                                considered as final and conclusive for determining the Purchase Date.</p>

                            <h2 style="font-size: 20px;" class="mt-4 fw-bold">2. Upgraded Subscriptions</h2>
                            <p>Company may permit Users to upgrade their subscription by purchasing a higher-priced
                                subscription. Where a User upgrades their subscription, the refund shall be governed by
                                the Purchase Date and not from the date of upgrade of subscription ("Upgrade Date"). To
                                clarify, a User who avails an upgrade is eligible for refund upon cancellation of the
                                subscription within 7 days from the Purchase Date only.</p>

                            <h2 style="font-size: 20px;" class="mt-4 fw-bold">3. Refund Ineligibility</h2>
                            <p>Under no circumstance shall a User be entitled to a refund upon cancellation of
                                subscription after 7 days from the Purchase Date.</p>

                            <h2 style="font-size: 20px;" class="mt-4 fw-bold">4. Cancellation and Refund Request Process</h2>
                            <p>All requests for cancellation of subscription and refund should be raised only via the
                                customer support helpline provided by Company. Cancellation and refund requests raised
                                through any other mode of communication shall not be considered for refund.</p>

                            <h2 style="font-size: 20px;" class="mt-4 fw-bold">5. Refund Processing</h2>
                            <p>Company has arrangements with banks, affiliates, payment gateways, payment aggregators,
                                and other financial service providers for processing refunds ("Service Providers").
                                Company endeavours to ensure that eligible refunds are processed within 20 working days
                                of your request for cancellation of subscription. However, this timeline is indicative
                                and processing of refunds is subject to the time taken by the Service Providers. The
                                User agrees to provide any information required to facilitate refunds, including but not
                                limited to bank account details, bank branch names, UPI addresses, and IFSC codes. The
                                User acknowledges and agrees that remittance of refund to the User is subject to the
                                charges that may be levied by the Service Providers for such remittance. Such charges
                                shall be deducted from the refund claimed by the User.</p>

                            <h2 class="mt-4 fw-bold">6. Referral Code/Referral Link Subscriptions</h2>
                            <p>Notwithstanding anything contained in any other clause of this policy, this Cancellation
                                and Refund Policy shall not apply to the Users who register and purchase subscription of
                                Company Products using the referral code/referral link of existing Company Users. By
                                purchasing a subscription, the User acknowledges and agrees to the terms and conditions
                                of this Cancellation and Refund Policy.</p>
